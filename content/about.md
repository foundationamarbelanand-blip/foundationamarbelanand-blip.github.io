A global Awakening through Divine Vibration and selfless Service.  

In this sacred age of transmission, AMARBELANAND FOUNDATION stands as a beacon of Supreme Divine-guiding humanity the Supreme Truth, the eternal formless vibration that transcends time, space and sound.

Rooted in the realization of the Absolute, we are here to awaken every soul through the path of true Yoga, beyond dogma, beyond rituals-directly into the embrace of divine.

Our mission flows not only through spiritual awakening but through action-free hospitals, holistic education,  welfare centres and global outreach-dedicated to the upliftment of all, beyond all barriers.

This is more than a foundation-it is a living movement of divine grace, born from unconditional love, the healing, enlightenment, and transformation of all life.
